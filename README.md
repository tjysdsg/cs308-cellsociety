Start Date: Feb 18th 2021 for the complete implementation part
basic implementation was done earlier.

Finish Date: Feb 22th 2021

oracle docs for javafx. 


### Running the Program

Main class: `Main` in the `CellSocieity` directory

Data files needed: files in data. Especially, cssfiles, gameconfigs, and propoerties files.

Features implemented: 

1. UI
   * Splash screen for different language options
    * All buttons (save progress button, hide/show Population Graph button), control panel buttons.
    * DropDownLists for color, css, different xml configurations.
   * Slider to control speed
   * Display Status, such as current number of fish
   * Population Graph, multiple lined graph each track the progression
   of a species. Make sure it doesn't go over a certain range. 
   * Ability to create new windows of simulation
   * Spinners for users to dynamically control certain inherent properties
   during the simulation, such as fish breed time.
   * etc.
   



### Notes/Assumptions

Interesting data files:

We like the italian.properties file, which we translated on our own
with using google
